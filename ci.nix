# This file provides all the buildable and cacheable packages and
# package outputs in your package set. These are what gets built by CI,
# so if you correctly mark packages as
#
# - broken (using `meta.broken`),
# - unfree (using `meta.license.free`), and
# - locally built (using `preferLocalBuild`)
#
# then your CI will be able to build and cache only those packages for
# which this is possible.
